# Expositions

- A constructive proof of Lie's third theorem for Lie algebras (handwritten notes): [part I](/pdfs/constructive-proof-lie-third-theorem-part-i.pdf), [part II](/pdfs/constructive-proof-lie-third-theorem-part-ii.pdf). This is an exposition of the integration technique from the book by Duistermaat and Kolk, which was presented at the *Integration seminar* in Spring 2024.
